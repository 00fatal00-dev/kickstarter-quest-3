# Coding Guidelines

This document describes GDScript coding style and best practices to organize code base to keep sane when developing mid-to-large projects.

The ideas exposed below take inspiration from good practices from different paradigms and languages, especially from Python and functional programming, as well as the official GDScript documentation.

There isnâ€™t a straightforward way of transposing these ideas into an object-oriented setting such as when working with Godot since it has its way of handling interactions.

To create modular and composable systems, we have to manage boundaries: the places where different game systems interact with one another. Especially the interaction of the game systems with the user.

## Code Writing Style

This section shows our programming style by example.

<!-- TODO: Add a short but complete, real-world example -->

```gdscript
extends Node

"""
A brief description of the class's role and functionality

A longer description, if needed, possibly of multiple paragraphs. Properties
and method names should be in backticks like so: `_process`, `x` etc.

Notes
-----
Specific things that don't fit the class's description above.

Keep lines under 100 characters long
"""
```

Include `class_name` only if necessary: if you need to check for this type in other classes, or to be able to create the node in the create node dialogue.

```gdscript
class_name MyNode
```

Signals go first and don't use parentheses unless they pass function parameters. Use the past tense to name signals. Append `_started` or `_finished` if the signal corresponds to the beginning or the end of an action.

```gdscript
signal moved
signal talk_started(parameter_name)
signal talk_finished
```

Place `onready` variables after signals, because we mostly use them to keep track of child nodes this class accesses. Having them at the top of the file makes it easier to keep track of dependencies.

```gdscript
onready var timer : = $Timer
onready var ysort : = $YSort
```

After that, place exported variables, then constants, then enums. The enums' names should be in `CamelCase` while the values themselves should be in `ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE`.

```gdscript
export(int) var number

const MAX_TRIALS : = 3
const TARGET_POSITION : = Vector2(2, 56)

enum TileTypes { EMPTY=-1, WALL, DOOR }
```

Follow enums with member variables. Their names should use `snake_case`. Define setters and getters when properties alter their behavior instead of using methods to access them. They should start with an `_` to indicate these are private methods, and use the names `_set_variable_name`, `_get_variable_name`.

```gdscript
var animation_length : = 1.5
var tile_size : = 40
var side_length : = 5 setget _set_side_length, _get_side_length
```

Define private and virtual methods, starting with a leading `_`.

```gdscript
func _init() -> void:
  pass

func _process(delta: float) -> void:
  pass
```

Then define public methods. Include type hints for variables and the return type.

You can use a brief docstring, if need be, to describe what the function does and what it returns. To describe the return value in the docstring, start the sentence with `Returns`. Use the present tense and direct voice. See Godot's [documentation writing guidelines](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/contributing/docs_writing_guidelines.html) for more information.

```gdscript
func can_move(cell_coordinates: Vector2) -> bool:
  return grid[cell_coordinates] != TileTypes.WALL
```

Use `return` only at the beginning and end of functions. If `return` is at the beginning, you can use it as a defense mechanism in an `if` statement.

**Don't** return in the middle of the method. It makes it harder to track returned values. Here's an example of a **clean** and readable method:

```gdscript
func start_quest(id: String) -> Quest:
  """
  Finds the quest corresponding to the `id` in the database and calls its start
  method.
  Returns the Quest object so other nodes can connect to its signals.
  """
  var quest : = get_quest_from_database(id)
  if not quest:
    return null
  quest.start()
  return quest
```

Another example of a function with **good** return statements:

```gdscript
func _set_elements(elements: int) -> bool:
  """
  Sets up shadow scale, number of visual elements and instantiates as needed.
  Returns true/false depending on success.
  """
  if not has_node("SkinViewport") or \
     elements > ELEMENTS_MAX or \
     not has_node("Shadow"):
    return false

  # if verification doesn't fail proceed with normal business
  var skinviewport : = $SkinViewport
  var skinviewport_staticbody : = $SkinViewport/StaticBody2D
  for i in skinviewport.get_children():
    if i != skinviewport_staticbbody:
      i.queue_free()

  var interval : = INTERVAL
  var r : = RandomNumberGenerator.new()
  r.randomize()
  for i in range(elements):
    var e : = Element.new()
    e.node_a = "../StaticBody2D"
    e.position = skinviewport_staticbody.position
    e.position.x += r.randf_range(interval.x, interval.y)
    interval = interval.rotated(PI/2)
    skinviewport.add_child(e)

  var shadow : = $Shadow
  shadow.scale = SHADOW.scale * (1.0 + elements/6.0)
  return true
```

### On the use of `null`

`None`, `null`, `NULL`, etc. references could be the biggest mistake in the history of computing, coming from the man that invented it himself: [Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare).

For programming languages that depend on `null` such as GDScript it's impossible to get rid of `null` usage completely because a lot of its functionality relies on built-in functions that work/return `null` values. But why would we care about it? In simple terms, `null` is a value that behaves like any other value in any context which means that the compiler can't warn us about mistakes caused by `null` at compile time. Which in turn means that `null` exceptions will only be visible at runtime. This is bad and it should be avoided like the plague.

In general there are sensible option for initializing variables of certaing types without the need for `null`. For example, if a function returns a positive `int` number, then upon failure to calculate the desired return value, the function could return `-1` instead of `null` to signify the error.

So the key takeaway is: **use `null` only if you're forced to**. Instead think about alternative ways of implementing the same functionality using regular types.

### [Typed GDScript](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/static_typing.html)

In this project we'll be using [Typed GDScript](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/static_typing.html). At the time of this writing static GDScript typing doesn't provide any perofrmance boosts or any other compiler features just yet, but we'll be using as a training exercise to get used to it, because things like JIT (Just In Time) compilation and other nice improvements are on the Godot roadmap.

What typed GDScript provides right now is better code completion, and better warnings in the Godot text editor so even now it's quite a good improvement over dynamically typed GDScript.

Be sure to check [Static typing in GDScript](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/static_typing.html) to get an idea of how static typing works.

Normally we define typed variables like this:

```gdscript
var x : Vector2 = some_function_returning_Vector2(param1, param2)
```

but if `some_function_returning_Vector2` is also annotated with a return type:

```gdscript
func some_function_returning_Vector2(param1: int, param2: int) -> Vector2:
  # do some work
  return Vector2()
```

then Godot can infer the type for us so we can define the variable like so:

```
var v : = some_function_returning_Vector2(param1, param2)
```

omitting the type after the colon.

_note_ that we still use the collon in the assignment, `: =`, it isn't a simple `=`. This instructs Godot to try and figure out the type, while using the simple `=` would revert to dynamically typed GDScript.

_note_ that we use `: =` with space in between, rather than `:=`. Godot doesn't enforce type hining, but since we want to impose it on ourselves, `: =` is easier to spot in comparison with `=` if we forget to use the colon.

Whenever we can we'll let Godot do the type inference for us. It's less error prone because the sistem keeps better track of types than we can and it forces us to have proper return values for all functions we use.

Now we're not out of the woods yet. Since the static type system is mostly for better engine warnings and it isn't enforced, at times we need to help it out. The following snippet will make the problem clear:

```gdscript
var arr : = [1, 'test']
var s : String = arr.pop_back()
var i : int = arr.pop_back()
```

The `Array` type is a container that can keep a mixture of diffrent types, like in the above example where we have `int` & `String` stored in it. If we had written `var s : = arr.pop_back()` instead, then Godot would have complained because it can't figure out the return type of `pop_back` function. You can see this clearly in the documentation (press `F4` and search `pop_back`):

```
Variant pop_back()
  Remove the last element of the array.
```

As you can see, the function returns the type `Variant`. This is a generic type that can hold any other Godot type. In times like these we have to help the type system by being explicit about it: `var s : String = arr.pop_back()`.

When doing this we need to be extremely cautious since the following is also valid, doesn't produce any warnings/errors and it runs just fine even:

```gdscript
var arr : = [1, 'test']
var s : int = arr.pop_back()
var i : String = arr.pop_back()
```

Since the Godot type system is at its infancy and for the most part is a hiting system rather than a retular static type system, we do end up with these corner cases that we have to be careful about. So especially whenever working with Godot functions that return `Variant` we need to keep this in mind.

In the above example, at runtime `s` will still hold a `String`, and `i` will still hold an int, but cheking them with `s is String`, `i is int` returns `false`. So the Godot static type system has strenghts, but also weaknesses that we have to be aware of.
